### Hi there 👋 I'm Alexis.

I am a frontend developer and a JS lover. I am currently working with React  ⚛, but I am always looking for new opportunities to learn new stuff.

I’m open to collaborate on projects and help people that are learning HTML, CSS or JS.

Below is a list of my recent repositories:

- [HotelScanner](https://github.com/alazzuri/hotelScanner) 🏨 
- [The Weather App](https://github.com/alazzuri/weather-app) ☀️ ☔ ☁️
- [CocktailFinder](https://github.com/alazzuri/CocktailFinder) 🍹


You could find me on Twitter as [@alezzuri](https://twitter.com/alezzuri).
